# Southern Water Corporation Revenue Increase Opportunity

## Problem Statement

The Southern Water Corporation is seeking to increase revenue by studying the Cost to Produce water and resolving sizable discrepancies in the calendar year's budget. The corporation faces an increase in demand for desalinated water, and revenues have surged as a result. This project aims to provide accountability and a detailed breakdown for Cost to Produce (CTP) water while conducting Year-to-Date Variance Analysis to identify significant discrepancies in budget figures.

## Context

Southern Water Corp operates three functional plants (Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik) to meet the demand for desalinated water. Due to the constant demand, the plants are functioning above and beyond their regular capacity. The management has tasked the Financial Business Unit (FBU) to analyze the financial data and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Criteria for Success

- Identify sizable discrepancies between actual and budget figures.
- Establish accountability for Cost to Produce water (CTP) drivers.
- Detect unusual figures in the business' financial health reports.

## Scope of Solution Space

The analysis will focus on the following areas:

- Revenue, Production Costs, Earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT), Depreciation, and Amortization.
- Year-to-Date Variance Analysis for actual and budget figures.
- Cost to Produce (CTP) drivers.

## Libraries Used

The analysis will utilize the following Python libraries:

- matplotlib.dates: Used for formatting dates in Matplotlib plots.
- seaborn: Used for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- statsmodels.api: Used for performing statistical modeling and analysis.
- numpy: Used for numerical computing and array operations.
- sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler: Used for standardizing numerical features.
- imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE: Used for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to handle imbalanced data.
- imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler: Used for random under-sampling to balance data.
- imblearn.pipeline.make_pipeline: Used for creating pipelines with imbalanced data handling techniques.
